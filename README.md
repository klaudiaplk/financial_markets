# Financial Market Project

Stock price forecasting has been a very popular topic for a long time. However, due to the complexity and randomness in the stock market, it is particularly difficult to accurately predict future stock prices. Under normal circumstances, investors and researchers will use some empirical formulas to calculate a large number of more effective factors from the original stock price information such as historical stock prices, trading volume, company financial reports, etc. In this report, our aim was to predict "Close" prices beside LSTM and GAN models and compare the results using RMSE values. In addition, we also looked at perfomance for learned models using basic features such as Low, High or Close and using additional technical analysis indicators such as CCI, STOCH RSI, MACD to understand the impact of input data on our models.
